Homemade project

The task is to create whole front-end for a service aggregating theatres

1. clone repo
2. npm run start
3. enjoy

Please note that much more functionality is on 'play-details' branch because it was my first project ever, more a learning tool than something intended to publish. I didn't know any of the principals of coding or any other this kind of thing. Still, IMO, it is something worth looking at, considering the complexity of the output and the fact it was all made by someone with close to zero knowledge, skills and zero experience
